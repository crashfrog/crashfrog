Dear sir or madam,

Please find enclosed my CV for the position of Microbiologist GS-403-11, as posted at www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/387079300 . â€‹I think that you and your search team will see that I'm the ideal applicant - a multilanguage, full-stack, polyglot programmer with ample experience wrangling high-throughput next-gen sequencing of bacterial pathogens, on every currently marketed sequencing platform (and at least one that hasn't yet come to market.) Of course, I'm most ideal because I already perform the duties of this position.

As part of my ORISE fellowship with the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, I've taken a leading role in streamlining the operation of a multi-site, multi-state NGS network - FDA-CFSAN's heralded GenomeTrakr project - that combines high-throughput surveillance-mode sequencing of food-borne pathogens with high-performance QA/QC, assembly, and open-data public release via NCBI's Sequence Read Archive. To date, my systems have been responsible for a growing dataset of over 10,000 bacterial genomes released to the scientific community and freely to the public, as well as supporting actions in the regulatory sphere that have shut down dangerous food-safety violators. I'm the developer of SRA-quick-submit, a Python tool used by other Federal and academic research groups to make their own GenomeTrakr contributions, and of BaseCase, a web-based bioinformatics workflow system that leverages filesystem isolation tools like Docker to enable complex analysis workflows to operate on streaming NGS data and be shared among diverse researchers without the complexity of managing dozens of best-of-breed bioinformatics tools in the same Linux/UNIX install. FDA-CFSAN hopes to roll this system out early next year, and provide it free of charge (and under open-source license) to the broader bioinformatics community, with the hope of fostering a robust exchange and comparison of workflows and pipelines for a broad range of biotechnology applications.

I've been immensely proud to work alongside some of the leading lights in the practical application of bacterial NGS and genomic science, and I believe I'm ready to step into the role as a full employee. I believe I can offer a unique and valuable mix of technological and biological expertise. If you and your group believe the same thing, I can be reached to arrange an interview at this email (justin.payne@fda.hhs.gov) or by phone at 402-909-1436.

Thanks for your prompt attention,
