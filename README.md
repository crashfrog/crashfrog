I'm a Python and Java developer, one of the primary developers of the FDA's GenomeTrakr whole-genome pathogen biosurveillance network, an application scientist and admin on GalaxyTrakr, and the primary author of tools such as Bootsie and PoreRefiner. Recently rated "alright" by one of two cats who live in my condo.
