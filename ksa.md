-------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Knowledge of molecular laboratory methods and data analytics with a specialization in next-generation sequencing technologies

In my current role as Microbiologist/Bioinformatician at FDA-CFSAN I, under a fellowship through the Oak Ride Associated Universities ORISE program, have already been performing all of the duties which are required under the announced position. I've received training both academically and by FDA-CFSAN staff in molecular lab techniques with a focus on microbiological methods and whole-genome sequencing on a variety of platforms, including IonTorrent, Illumina MiSeq, and PacBio RSII. My primary duties have been the analysis of bacterial genome sequencing data, however; in this role I've used **advanced computational analysis tools to characterize strains and types, find genes, derive evolutionary relationships, and provide real analytical value** to other team members and to FDA, CDC, and USDA epidemiologists.

> Ability to develop whole-genome sequence based bioinformatic pipelines to aid in detection, identification, and characterization of microbial foodborne pathogens

In my current role as ORISE Microbiologist/Bioinformatician at FDA-CFSAN, I've used programming languages including Java and Python to **design, architect, implement, and maintain bioinformatic pipelines** for whole-genome sequence data, including a high-performance, cluster-based genomic assembly pipeline (using best-of-breed genomic assembly tools such as SPAdes and MIRA), two high-performance Quality Assurance/Quality Control pipelines (QA/QC), and a high-throughput genomic collaboration and sharing pipeline (supporting the multi-agency GenomeTrakr real-time WGS pathogen surveillance network.) I've maintained nearly 100% uptime of these systems and implemented innumerable process improvements and feature requests, driven by FDA-CFSAN collaborators and stakeholders.

> Ability to analyze and assess the quality and accuracy of genomic data

In my current role as ORISE Microbiologist/Bioinformatician at FDA-CFSAN, I've used programming languages including Java and Python to design, architect, implement, and maintain bioinformatic pipelines for whole-genome sequence data including two high-performance Quality Assurance/Quality Control pipelines (QA/QC). I'm also the developer and architect of an in-development system to monitor genomic data for an abundance of failure pathologies, including invalid read order, adapter contamination, library contamination, sample contamination, sequencing errors, PCR duplicates, metadata errors, and general low-quality reads using best-of-breed bioinformatics tools such as **FASTX Toolkit, Scythe, Quake, Hammer, Kraken, and FastQC.**

> Ability to technically mentor and train

In my current role as ORISE Microbiologist/Bioinformatician at FDA-CFSAN, I've repeatedly been called upon, formally and informally, to train new personnel in the use of our department-specific informatic systems (including those of my own creation, such as the SIF Toolkit). I've presented lectures and training material on innumerable occasions to brief and train FDA-CFSAN users and stakeholders on technology, scientific applications, and new user tools.

> Ability to integrate new bioinformatics analyses into existing databases, software, and analysis pipelines

This has been the primary task in my current position as ORISE Microbiologist/Bioinformatician at FDA-CFSAN. Using programming languages such as Java and Python, I've created a high-performance, cluster-based genomic assembly pipeline (using best-of-breed genomic assembly tools such as SPAdes and MIRA), two high-performance Quality Assurance/Quality Control pipelines (QA/QC), and a high-throughput genomic collaboration and sharing pipeline (supporting the multi-agency GenomeTrakr real-time WGS pathogen surveillance network.) All of the above required **intensive, closely-tied integration with existing databases and software,** including our own GenomicsDB, Illumina's cloud-based Basespace infrastructure, and eight different databases hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, the nation's clearinghouse and public repository for biological sequence data and other digital analysis results.

> Ability to effectively communicate orally / Ability to effectively communicate in writing

As both a scientist and a programmer, probably no single skill has been more important to my success in this field than the ability to communicate orally and in writing. Most important, of course, among the steps of the scientific method is communicating and sharing your results. Programming, too, is as much an effort in communicating with other programmers, engineers, and system architects as it is an effort in communicating with a computer. **My skills in written communication are extensive** - I studied English literature for two years as an undergraduate, have written and been published in a wide variety of formats including newspapers, periodicals, scientific journals, presentations, online materials, handouts, training materials, patent applications, grants, proposals, quad charts, and advertising materials.

> Additionally, **I'm an experienced oral communicator.** From an early adolescence in stage acting to the innumerable times in my current role, I've stood before an audience to tell a story, deliver a briefing, warn of an issue, advise on a problem, announce a discovery, celebrate a life. I'm extremely skilled at extemporaneous speaking, planned oratory, poetic recital, dinner conversation, warm-up comedy, and briefing four-star generals and presidents of companies. But chief among my communication skills is that skill which is of greatest importance to the use of science towards the public health: the ability to communicate complex concepts in simple terms, which was a skill I had ample opportunity to develop in my position as Tech Support Consultant at Gustavus Adophus College, where I had to assist students, staff, and faculty with puzzling computer issues over a phone call.
