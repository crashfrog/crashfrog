Relevant KSA for **Computer Scientist (Scientific Programmer)**, HHS-FDA-DE-18-10180473
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> **One year of specialized experience equivalent to the next lower grade of GS 12 or equivalent band level of responsibility in the federal service configuring, managing and troubleshooting Oracle databases (version 11g or newer).**

In my current role as Microbiologist/Bioinformatician at FDA-CFSAN, I've deployed, configured, and administered a number of relational and graph databases for purposes of NGS biosurveillance including Sqlite, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Neo4J, and Oracle. I developed mission-critical schemas and data models in these technologies, developed and wrote queries in their respective query languages, and assisted others in doing the same. Using programming languages such as Java and Python, I've created a high-performance, cluster-based genomic assembly pipeline (using best-of-breed genomic assembly tools such as SPAdes and MIRA), two high-performance Quality Assurance/Quality Control pipelines (QA/QC), and a high-throughput genomic collaboration and sharing pipeline (supporting the multi-agency GenomeTrakr real-time WGS pathogen surveillance network.) All of the above required **intensive, closely-tied integration with existing databases and software,** including our own GenomicsDB, Illumina's cloud-based Basespace infrastructure, and eight different databases hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, the nation's clearinghouse and public repository for biological sequence data and other digital analysis results.

> **Experience with working with a Linux or Unix operating system such as Red Hat, Centos, or Solaris is essential.**

In my current role as Microbiologist/Bioinformatician at FDA-CFSAN I regularly use Linux operating systems such as CentOS and Ubuntu and am extremely familiar with the operation, administration, and maintenance of these environments. I'm an experienced software developer on these platforms, both in a workstation and server-hosted context. I've used programming languages including Java and Python to **design, architect, implement, and maintain bioinformatic pipelines** for whole-genome sequence data, including a high-performance, cluster-based genomic assembly pipeline (using best-of-breed genomic assembly tools such as SPAdes and MIRA), two high-performance Quality Assurance/Quality Control pipelines (QA/QC), and a high-throughput genomic collaboration and sharing pipeline (supporting the multi-agency GenomeTrakr real-time WGS pathogen surveillance network.) I've maintained nearly 100% uptime of these systems and implemented innumerable process improvements and feature requests, driven by FDA-CFSAN collaborators and stakeholders.

> **Ability to effectively communicate orally / Ability to effectively communicate in writing**

As both a scientist and a programmer, probably no single skill has been more important to my success in this field than the ability to communicate orally and in writing. Most important, of course, among the steps of the scientific method is communicating and sharing your results. Programming, too, is as much an effort in communicating with other programmers, engineers, and system architects as it is an effort in communicating with a computer. **My skills in written communication are extensive** - I studied English literature for two years as an undergraduate, have written and been published in a wide variety of formats including newspapers, periodicals, scientific journals, presentations, online materials, handouts, training materials, patent applications, grants, proposals, quad charts, and advertising materials.

Additionally, **I'm an experienced oral communicator.** From an early adolescence in stage acting to the innumerable times in my current role, I've stood before an audience to tell a story, deliver a briefing, warn of an issue, advise on a problem, announce a discovery, celebrate a life. I'm extremely skilled at extemporaneous speaking, planned oratory, poetic recital, dinner conversation, warm-up comedy, and briefing four-star generals and presidents of companies. But chief among my communication skills is that skill which is of greatest importance to the use of science towards the public health: the ability to communicate complex concepts in simple terms, which was a skill I had ample opportunity to develop in my position as Tech Support Consultant at Gustavus Adophus College, where I had to assist students, staff, and faculty with puzzling computer issues over a phone call.
